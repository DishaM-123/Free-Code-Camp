        <p>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) is one of the most celebrated freedom fighters
          of India.</p>
        <p>In 1942, he earned the title ‘Netaji’, in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj.</p>
        <p>Bose is credited with the very famous slogan, “Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!” as well as “Jai
          Hind”.</p>
        <p>He is also credited to be the first man to call Mahatma Gandhi “Father of the Nation”, in his address from
          Singapore.</p>
        <p>In 1919, Bose headed to London to give the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination and he was selected. Bose,
          however, resigned from Civil Services as he believed he could not side with the British.</p>
        <p>In 1921, Bose worked under Chittaranjan Das, a powerful politician in Bengal. He worked as the editor for
          Das’s newspaper, Forward, and later started his own newspaper, Swaraj.</p>
        <p>In 1923, Bose was elected the President of the All India Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal
          State Congress.</p>
        <p>During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe. He researched and wrote the first part of his book, The Indian
          Struggle, which covered the country’s independence movement in the years 1920–1934.</p>
