                    React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It is used for handling the view layer for web
                    and
                    mobile apps. ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most
                    popular
                    JavaScript libraries and has a strong foundation and large community behind it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official
                    documentation,
                    following is the definition −
                    React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable
                    UI components,
                    which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts
                    away the DOM
                    from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the
                    server using Node,
                    and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which
                    reduces the boilerplate
                    and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
                <ol>
                    <li>Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance,
                        since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
                    </li>
                    <li>Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li> Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>React uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. It is not necessary to use it,
                        however, following are some pros that come with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.
                    </li>
                    <li>It makes it easier and faster to write templates, if you are familiar with HTML.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>JSX looks like a regular HTML in most cases. We already used it in the Environment Setup chapter.
                    Look at the code from App.jsx where we are returning div.
                    <code>import React from 'react';

                    class App extends React.Component {
                       render() {
                          return (
                                Hello World!!!
                          );
                       }
                    }
                    export default App;
                    </code>

                <h3>Stateless Example</h3>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Our first component in the following example is App. This component is owner of Header and Content.
                    We are creating Header and Content separately and just adding it inside JSX tree in our App
                    component.
                    Only App component needs to be exported.</p>
                <header>
                    <h4>Stateful Example</h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    In this example, we will set the state for owner component (App). The Header component is just added
                    like in
                    the last example since it doesn't need any state. Instead of content tag, we are creating table and
                    tbody elements,
                    where we will dynamically insert TableRow for every object from the data array.
                    It can be seen that we are using EcmaScript 2015 arrow syntax (=>) which looks much cleaner than the
                    old JavaScript syntax.
                    This will help us create our elements with fewer lines of code. It is especially useful when we need
                    to create a list with a
                    lot of items.

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>State is the place where the data comes from. We should always try to make our state as simple as
                    possible and minimize
                    the number of stateful components. If we have, for example, ten components that need data from the
                    state, we should create
                    one container component that will keep the state for all of them.
                </p>
                <p>The following sample code shows how to create a stateful component using EcmaScript2016 syntax.</p>
                <code>import React from 'react';

        class App extends React.Component {
           constructor(props) {
              super(props);  
              this.state = {
                 header: "Header from state...",
                 content: "Content from state..."
              }
           }
           render() {
              return (
                    {this.state.header}
                    {this.state.content}
              );
           }
        }
        export default App; 
        </code>

                <h2>Props Overview</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The main difference between state and props is that props are immutable. This is why the container
                    component should
                    define the state that can be updated and changed, while the child components should only pass data
                    from the state
                    using props.
                </p>
                <p>You can also set default property values directly on the component constructor instead of adding it
                    to the
                    reactDom.render() element.
                </p>
                <p> We are setting the state in our parent component and passing it down the component tree using props.
                    Inside the render function, we are setting headerProp and contentProp used in child components.
                </p>

        <section id="Props Validation" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Props Validation</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Properties validation is a useful way to force the correct usage of the components.
                    This will help during development to avoid future bugs and problems, once the app becomes larger. I
                    t also makes the code more readable, since we can see how each component should be used.
                </p>
                <p>In this example, we are creating App component with all the props that we need. App.propTypes is used
                    for
                    props validation. If some of the props aren't using the correct type that we assigned, we will get a
                    console warning.
                    After we specify validation patterns, we will set App.defaultProps.
                </p>
                <code>import React from 'react';

                    three methods: setState(), forceUpdate and ReactDOM.findDOMNode(). In new ES6 classes, we have to
                    manually bind this.
                    We will use this.method.bind(this) in the examples.

                <p>setState() method is used to update the state of the component. This method will not replace the

                    but only add changes to the original state.

                <p>componentDidMount is executed after the first render only on the client side.
                    This is where AJAX requests and DOM or state updates should occur.
                    This method is also used for integration with other JavaScript frameworks and any functions with
                    delayed execution
                    such as setTimeout or setInterval. We are using it to update the state so we can trigger the other
                    lifecycle methods.
                </p>
                <p>componentWillReceiveProps is invoked as soon as the props are updated before another render is
                    called.
                    We triggered it from setNewNumber when we updated the state.

                <p>shouldComponentUpdate should return true or false value. This will determine if the component will be
                    updated or not.
                    This is set to true by default. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after
                    state or props are updated,
                    you can return false value.

                <p>React keys are useful when working with dynamically created components or when your lists are altered
                    by the users.
                    Setting the key value will keep your components uniquely identified after the change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map function will create three elements from our data array. Since the key value needs to be
                    unique for every element,
                    we will assign i as a key for each created element.

            <article>
                <p>Flux is a programming concept, where the data is uni-directional.
                    This data enters the app and flows through it in one direction until it is rendered on the screen.
                <ol>
                    <li>a simple explanation of the flux concept:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Actions − Actions are sent to the dispatcher to trigger the data flow.</li>
                        <li>Dispatcher − This is a central hub of the app. All the data is dispatched and sent to the
                            stores. </li>
                        <li>Store − Store is the place where the application state and logic are held.
                            Every store is maintaining a particular state and it will update when needed. </li>
                        <li>View − The view will receive data from the store and re-render the app.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>This is a simple example where we will only use one component.
                    We are just adding onClick event that will trigger updateState function once the button is clicked.
                </p>
                <code>import React from 'react';

                <p>When we need to update the state of the parent component from its child,
                    we can create an event handler (updateState) in the parent component and pass it as a prop
                    (updateStateProp)
                    to the child component where we can just call it.

                <p>Step 1 - Install a React Router
                    <code>C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install react-router
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>Step 2 - Create Components</p>
                <p>In this step, we will create four components. The App component will be used as a tab menu.
                    The other three components (Home), (About) and (Contact) are rendered once the route has changed.
                    <code>import React from 'react';
                    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

                                Contact
                                {this.props.children}
                          )
                       }
                    }
                    export default App;
                    
                    class Home extends React.Component {
                       render() {

                          )
                       }
                    }

                <p>Step 3 - Add a Router
                    Now, we will add routes to the app. Instead of rendering App element like in the previous example,
                    this time the Router will be rendered. We will also set components for each route.
                </p>
                <code>
                ReactDOM.render((

                       Route path = "/" component = {App}
                          IndexRoute component = {Home} /
                          Route path = "home" component = {Home} /
                          Route path = "about" component = {About} /
                          Route path = "contact" component = {Contact} /
                       Route
                    Router
                 ), document.getElementById('app'))

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Higher order components are JavaScript functions used for adding additional functionalities to the
                    existing component.
                    These functions are pure, which means they are receiving data and returning values according to that
                    data.
                    If the data changes, higher order functions are re-run with different data input.
                    If we want to update our returning component, we don't have to change the HOC.
                    All we need to do is change the data that our function is using.
                <ol>
                    <li>Higher Order Component (HOC) is wrapping around "normal" component and provide additional data
                        input.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is actually a function that takes one component and returns another component that wraps the
                        original one.
                    </li>
                    <li>The MyHOC is a higher order function that is used only to pass data to MyComponent.
                        This function takes MyComponent, enhances it with newData and returns the enhanced component
                        that
                        will be rendered on the screen.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <code>import React from 'react';

                var newData = {
                   data: 'Data from HOC...',
